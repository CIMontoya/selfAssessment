#Self Assessment - Block 1

1. **What areas do you feel you are struggling the most in? (Be specific, technologies, habits, etc.)**

I feel like I really struggle with CSS. I seem to always have a problem with bootstrap even though I always feel like I understand what each property I use does. I also need to commit better because I end up getting sucked into the code and forget the process.

2. **Develop a plan using S.M.A.R.T. goals to continue progress in the areas you mentioned above.** *S.M.A.R.T. - Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Relevant and Timely.*

If I want to get better with CSS, I could go into the lesson challenges for layout. I can push myself to complete at least one image in the span on three days.

For committing, I could try to separate my project into parts and commit after each one is complete.

3. **Look back at Block 1, choose 3 'aha' moments where something clicked and describe them below.**

a. When we went over arrow functions in class, suddenly many things were clear for me. Specifically, knowing that the return is implied in some cases.
b. I didn't really know what it meant that primitive data types are immutable. However, after learning that reference types have addresses, I get the concept better.
c. I prefer using for loops so when I was working on the functions checkpoint, I was having a bit of trouble. However, I stopped to think about what I wanted exactly and I ended up using a while loop because I thought it would be much easier and it worked.

4. **What areas do you feel the most confident in? What is making you happy right now?**

I am not overly confident in anything. However, I have had several moments where I just start working and everything in the code agrees with me. This is mostly for javascript and I still feel like I need to work on it.

Out of all my projects, I am proud of the pixel art maker the most.

5. **What technologies/industries are you most excited about currently?**

Not that I plan to go into this kind of industry, but I am really excited to see what the next generation of video games looks like.
